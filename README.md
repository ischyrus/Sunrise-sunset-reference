Sunrise-sunset Calculator
========================

This simple Java application will become the reference Sunrise-sunset calculation algorithm for a later C program.
The original implementation came from an ancient GW-BASIC program published by Sky & Telescope in the August 1994
issue on Page 84. Sky & Telescope has made the source code available for download 
[here](http://media.skyandtelescope.com/binary/sunup.bas). The mathetmatical algorithm was published in
1979 in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, vol. 41, p. 391-411, which you can view
[here](http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1979ApJS...41..391V/0000391.000.html).
